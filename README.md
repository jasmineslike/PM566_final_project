This is my PM566 Final Project website home. The website is online at https://jasmineslike.github.io/PM566_final_project/ .

My project is more about discovering the relationship between COVID-19 and age. According to the current situation, observe the vaccination situation of different age levels and make suggestions and summaries. The data all come from CDC's COVID Data Tracker(https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_dailycases).
